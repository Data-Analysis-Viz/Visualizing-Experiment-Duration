# Visualizing-Experiment-Duration

Helping marketers optimize their experimentation efforts

Conducting A/B test takes lot of effort both in terms of time and money. What if the traffic on your site is really low to conduct an A/B test. Hence, it is important to predetermine the expected experiment duration by estimating the sample size required for the test. This helps marketers to optimize their efforts for choosing the fastest and most efficinet test 

# Project Outline 

Determine Sample Size for A/B test using Power Analysis 

Calculated the Expected Experiment Duration 

Visualize Durations to determine the best possible test 

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

# Dependencies 

Run following commands in terminal/command_prompt

```
